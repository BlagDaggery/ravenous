# Ravenous
This program is an activity for the Codecademy intensive course "Build Front-End Web Applications from Scratch." In this project we were tasked with using the JavaScript library React to build a clone of Yelp, using data from the Yelp API.

## Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
